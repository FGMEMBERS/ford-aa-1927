Thank you for downloading 1927 Ford Model AA for Flightgear.
Music is by AJ Croce, 2005 SXSW and is edited to make it sound like coming out from car speakers. If you donâ€™t like the music or want to reduce the size of the folder, just go to the Sounds folder and remove music.wav

Deferred rendering (Rembrandt) should be enabled to make use of the headlights. Normal mode (Rembrandt and ALS disabled) can be used if your computer does not support Rembrandt. I strongly suggest you disable ALS because reflection function of the car will be gone and the model does not look as nice.
